CoMD
====

Classical molecular dynamics proxy application.

This is CoMD version 1.1
------------------------

CoMD is a reference implementation of typical classical molecular
dynamics algorithms and workloads.  It is created and maintained by
ExMatEx: Exascale Co-Design Center for Materials in Extreme Environments
(<a href="http://exmatex.org">exmatex.org</a>).  The
code is intended to serve as a vehicle for co-design by allowing
others to extend and/or reimplement it as needed to test performance of 
new architectures, programming models, etc.

This is a modified version of CoMD with support for checkpoint/restart
capabilities using POSIX IO.
